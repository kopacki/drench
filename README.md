# Drench game

This is a pet project for learning Elm. This repostiory contains both source and build code for Drench game.

## How to use it

Run `make bootstrap` to fetch all dependencies and install them as global node packages.

I recommend using `make build-watch` for development as it provides hot-reloading.

## Next steps

Altough `elm-review` and `elm-test` figure as dependencies, they are not currently set up and used. It's left intentionally to be back a few years later and fix it.
